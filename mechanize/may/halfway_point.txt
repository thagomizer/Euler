May Coding Challenge Update

We're at the halfway point.

Fun stats:
- The group has completed 411 problems
- The mean score is 9.7
- The median score is 3.5
- The standard deviation is 15.9

Next week I'll send out instructions for declaring whether you are in the Novice or Open divisions. 

Also a rule clarification: 
Winners must be able to meet me in person during the first week of June to collect their prize. 

I'd like winners to attend our Monthly meeting on June 3rd but if you can't makeit we'll work something out.


- Aja
